Hi, it depends with your use cases for rust.  Anyway, please go through these materials:

1. The Rust Book
2. Programming Rust book. 
3. Async Rust book.
4. The rustlings - a great place to get started with learning rust in a practical way, that is project based
 
For advanced Rust
1. The Rustonomicon - if you prefer to go bare metal. Away from web development.
2. Rust in action by Tim McNamara - the code examples used are geared towards systems programming.
3. Rust for Rustaceans by Jon Gjengset - Great info is shared here

For web development:
1. Zero to production in Rust - it teaches you how to write production ready idiomatic Rust code. A lot of concepts will be covered.

More to be added later coz the resources are so many.

Edit: Thank you so much for your feedback. I was able to add some books to the list. More to come
